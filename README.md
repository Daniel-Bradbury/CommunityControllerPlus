## :warning:PLEASE DO NOT CONNECT THE BOT TO THE MAIN STREAM:warning:
#### THIS CODE IS FOR PRIVATE OR SEPERATE USE ONLY


__The logon key for the bot's account has been removed from the code, so running the bot will not work unless you have a key for a seperate account__

__I will not be giving out this key to anyone other than to CommunityController and their admins__

#### Note: This is the base code. For any game-specific code visit the branches of this project. Branches will only be created for code that is no longer needed and current code will always be in the master branch
