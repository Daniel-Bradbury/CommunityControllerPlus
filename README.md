# CommunityControllerPlus
A bot add-on to the Community Controller twitch streams

REQUIREMENTS:
Node.js with npm (should come installed.)
Place index.js into a folder (ccplus, CommunityControllerPlus, etc), then run the following commands inside the folder:

npm init -y

npm install tmi.js --save

to start up the bot, enter command prompt in the folder, and type:

node index.js

...and it should work fine.

__Keep note that the logon key has been removed from the code, so running the bot will not work unless you own the key__

__I will not be giving out this key to anyone other than to CommunityController and their managers.__
